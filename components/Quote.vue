      I'm Bhaskar Barma, a 29-year-old boy from West Bengal, India. I'm
      developing websites since 2010 as an individual, to run my own startup
      concepts. Previously successfully ran a third-party Android app store and
      some other small profitable websites. Know the importance of web UI/UX and
      other technical fundamentals (SEO optimized, Valid Code, PageSpeed, etc.)
      when it comes to developing a production-ready website.
